# Blog Application
This project is a Blog Application built using ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server. The application allows users to create, manage, and view blog posts, with full support for database migrations and updates based on user actions.

# Features
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:
Users can create new blog posts, edit or delete existing posts, and view a list of all blog posts.
Post Categorization: Supports categorizing blog posts for better organization.
Responsive Design: Ensures a mobile-friendly and clean layout.
## Technologies Used
ASP.NET MVC: For developing the web application with an MVC architecture.

Entity Framework: Used for database management and interaction with SQL Server.

SQL Server: For data storage and management of blog posts, with database migrations to keep the schema in sync with code changes.

HTML/CSS: To ensure a responsive and modern design.

Database Management and Migrations
The application uses Entity Framework for database interaction, including migrations that allow the database schema to evolve as the application is updated. Migrations help keep the database synchronized with the application's data models and ensure smooth updates based on user actions.

Database Migrations: Migrations are used to apply changes to the database schema whenever the application's data models are updated.

Automatic Schema Updates: The application can apply migrations automatically, so whenever a user action (such as creating or updating a blog post) requires a change in the database structure, it is handled seamlessly.
